## About Me

I am a web developer fueled by a passion for crafting dynamic and responsive web applications. My journey into the world of technology began with a simple curiosity about how things work and a love for solving problems. Over the years, I've nurtured this curiosity through formal education and hands-on experiences, always striving to stay in tune with the latest trends and innovations in the field.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

1. **[Evangadi Forum](https://evangadi-forum-by-sum.netlify.app)**
   - A dynamic question-and-answer platform designed to connect users seeking knowledge with helpful responses through a clean, React-based frontend and a reliable backend deployed on Render.

   - A basic e-commerce application built with React and Firebase, designed to replicate a shopping experience. It includes product listings, a secure authentication system, shopping cart functionality, and responsive design.
